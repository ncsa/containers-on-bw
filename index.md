This is an introduction to container solutions for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.
Although we will go over a lot of material, our end goal is to teach you basic concepts related to
software containers in HPC.

> ## Attention
>
> 1. This is an early ("alpha") version of the lesson. As such, typos, minor mistakes, and
>    incomplete instructions are to be expected. Please let us know of any issues by emailing us
>    at [bw-eot@ncsa.illinois.edu](mailto:bw-eot@ncsa.illinois.edu) or by
>    submitting an issue or a pull request on GitHub. **Any and all contributions are welcome!**
> 2. At the very bottom of this (and all other) pages you can see that this lesson uses the template
>    of The Carpentries organization. This lesson, however, is not part of The Carpentries official
>    lesson portfolio. Therefore, please direct all questions and comments related to this lesson to
>    us.
> 3. Docker, Singularity, Shifter, and HPC Container Maker are complex software with plethora of
>    subcommands, options, and possible use cases. The main goal of this lesson is to help you
>    understand how to
>    use these tools for computational research. If you use any of these tools
>    in your research in a way not described in this lesson, please
>    [let us know](mailto:bw-eot@ncsa.illinois.edu)!
> 4. This lesson assumes that you're comfortable with using command shell on the machine you're
>    using for the workshop, whether this is a Linux, macOS, or Windows computer.
> 5. This lesson assumes that you can install software on the machine you're using for the workshop.
>    Usually, this means that your account on the machine has administrative privileges.
